# Import & modules
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn how to import functions, how to create modules and how to use command line arguments in **Python**.

## Technologies
* Shell Scripts are written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.4.3
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

| `3-infinite_add.py` | Prints the result of the addition of all arguments |
| `4-hidden_discovery.py` | Prints all the names defined by a compiled module |
| `5-variable_load.py` | Imports a variable from a file and prints its value |
| `100-my_calculator.py` | Imports all functions from a file and handles basics operations |
| `101-easy_print.py` | Prints `#pythoniscool`, followed by a new line |
| `102-magic_calculation.py` | Function that does exactly the same as a given Python bytecode |
| `103-fast_alphabet.py` | Prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line |
